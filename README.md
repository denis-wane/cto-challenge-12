This is a program that allows you to do the following:
  1.  Search for a twitter user
  2.  View that user's lists
  3.  Choose one of the user's lists
  4.  Follow all of the members of that list
  
In order to run this program, you must have a file already loaded with valid Twitter credentials.  The expected format is the following:

[SectionOne]
CONSUMER_KEY = <Your Consumer Key>
CONSUMER_SECRET = <Your Consumer Secret>
ACCESS_TOKEN = <Your Application Access Token>
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = <Your Application Access Token Secret>

The program will ask you where to locate this file.
