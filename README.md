This is a program that allows you to do the following:
  1.  Search for a twitter user
  2.  View that user's lists
  3.  Choose one of the user's lists
  4.  Follow all of the members of that list
  
In order to run this program, you must have a file already loaded with valid Twitter credentials.  There is a sample file in the proper format included (sample-twitter-secrets.txt).

The program will ask you where to locate this file.
